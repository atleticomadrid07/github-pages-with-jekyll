Analyzing Haverts(8.5)

Havertz struggled last season at Chelsea, recording 4 goals and 6 assists, racking up 91 points. However, during the latter part of the season, under Thomas Tuchel, 
Havertz exploded onto the scene, having the hand in more Chelsea goals than any other player. In addition, a Champions League Final goal and a impressive Euro 2020 
performance can only improve his form. If Lukaku signs for Chelsea, don't expect Havertz to play as a false 9 for Chelsea. He will probably play as an attacking 
midfielder or as a winger. If Werner and Lukaku can perform for Chelsea this season, I can see Havertz being the architect of the Chelsea team, notching assists and 
goals, just like his Bayer Leverkusen form.
For me, his late-season form has me excited for his future. This is set to be his breakout season at Chelsea, even with the signing of Lukaku. I will have him in my 
team for GW1, and we will see how he performs.
